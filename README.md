The idea is that your brain can get "exhausted" by the implications of what everyone says and does around you, and that training exercises can increase its capacity to understand, hold, and act on these.  (Others then give you more capacity in return.)

Could be a quiz: give human expressions, and ask the user to provide what they mean.  accept all answers but learn to unify them into human input.  Teach the user to respond in ways that include more and more of them.

So, for example maybe,

##### "ohhh this was such a weary day"
- they're tired
- they know you are a support to them
- they are looking to know you understand how tiring their day was
- they'll appreciate interactions that only reduce how tired they are
- "here, take my seat if you want somewhere to sit down" would meet all meaning parts.  a user could tell the system that this is true.
